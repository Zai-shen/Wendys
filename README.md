# WendysFriends

This project was generated with much love.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` to get served a *delicious* meal.

### Jokes aside

Important notice:
As seen on tuwel, horse breed and -image were made required parameters.
Also, because of security measures, exceptions don't get thrown in smallest detail to the recipient. This was done intentionally, because else parameter-sniffing could become a security loophole.
Ideally the frontend button (while viewing horses) would link to the owner, didn't quite work out.
