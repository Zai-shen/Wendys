A small Web Application developed for a University course. Users are able to store horse data and corresponding jockey data.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` to get served a *delicious* meal.

### Jokes aside

As seen on Tuwel, horse breed and -image were made required parameters.
Also, because of security measures, exceptions don't get thrown in smallest detail to the recipient. This was done intentionally, because else parameter-sniffing could become a security loophole.
